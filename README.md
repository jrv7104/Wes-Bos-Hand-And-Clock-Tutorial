# Wes Bos Hand and Clock Tutorial

This is an attempt to duplicate the hand and clock tutorial from one of Wes Bos' Javascript tutorials. All of the HTML, CSS and Javascript is in the HTML file.

While it was nice to write out the functions, I used his finished result as a reference. Even then, the second, minutes and hour hands are a bit short and doesn't quite match up the finished product. This is something that will be revisited down the road, but as of now it felt good to work with a little more Javascript again.
